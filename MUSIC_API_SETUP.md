# Music API Setup Guide

Your MUSE AI platform now supports professional AI music generation using Suno AI or Udio AI! This guide will help you set up access to these powerful music generation services.

## Why Professional Music Generation?

The previous implementation used Google's Gemini TTS (text-to-speech) model with workarounds to create music-like sounds. This approach had serious limitations:
- ‚ùå Poor quality vocals (robotic, unnatural)
- ‚ùå Terrible instrument sounds (onomatopoeia-based)
- ‚ùå No real music production
- ‚ùå Not actual songs

The new implementation uses **state-of-the-art AI music models** that:
- ‚úÖ Generate studio-quality music
- ‚úÖ Create realistic vocals with emotion and expression
- ‚úÖ Produce authentic instruments and arrangements
- ‚úÖ Generate complete, production-ready songs
- ‚úÖ Support all genres and styles

## Example Prompts

### Good Style Descriptions:

```
Upbeat pop song with acoustic guitar, hand claps, and electronic beats.
Tempo: 120 BPM. Happy and energetic mood. Clean vocals with harmonies.
```

```
Dark electronic synthwave with heavy bass, retro 80s synths, and
dramatic drums. Slow to medium tempo. Mysterious atmospheric mood.
```

```
Acoustic folk ballad with fingerpicked guitar and gentle piano.
Slow tempo. Intimate and emotional vocals. Warm and nostalgic feel.
